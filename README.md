TODO

Because the apis is a bit bitchy, I cannot use the "today" for dates (needs to be "2012-04-01", "today" only works on time series like activities/steps, not /body/log/weight. Also, I can't use the "max" period, but because it's not supported from /body/log/weight, only 1m is supported for both.
